### Credits

#### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentor Luke who has continued to help me with my coding journey, offering constructive feedback to make the most of my new skills in learning Python.<br>

I also want to thank Sherry_lead on slack who stepped in when I was first starting this project and facing a mental barrier to get started. Working with Sherry helped me to get over the intiial barier as a result of an incompatable keyboard library I was trying to use. Her encouragement and support were instrumental in inspiring me to get started with this project.<br>

Lastly I would like to thank the Slack community as a whole with Code Institute, who are always ready to offer a helping hand or words of encouragement whilst on this learning journey.
